### Installation

Installation is easy-peasy if you're using [Vundle][2]. Just add this to your *.vimrc* file:

```vim
Bundle 'joonty/vim-tork.git'
```
and run `vim +BundleInstall +qall` from a terminal.

If you aren't using vundle, you will have to extract the files in each folder to the correct folder in *.vim/*.

**Note:** your vim installation must be compiled with *ruby* for this plugin to work.
